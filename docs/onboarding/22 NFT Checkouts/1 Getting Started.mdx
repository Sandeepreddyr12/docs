Get your checkout up and running in a few steps!

## Prerequisite: Deploy your smart contract

You can create or deploy a Checkouts-compatible smart contract on thirdweb using [Deploy](https://thirdweb.com/dashboard/contracts/deploy).

## 1. Register your contract for Checkouts

Visit the Payments dashboard or use the API to register your contract for checkouts. TODO: more info & images here once dashboard is up.

## 2. Create your checkout

Generate a complete, pre-built checkout experience by [creating a checkout link](checkout-link).

Want a more branded checkout embedded in your app? Visit the guide on [Embedded Checkout Elements](elements) instead.

## 3. Launch!

Make sure to review the [Go Live Checklist ðŸš€](go-live-checklist) prior to launch to ensure your setup is launch-ready.

**Important note: you must provide personal documents (KYC) and business documents (KYB) prior to launching on mainnet.**

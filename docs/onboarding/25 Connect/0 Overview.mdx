# Connect

thirdweb Connect is a complete toolkit for connecting wallets to frontend apps in React and React Native, games in Unity and in the backend with full TypeScript support.

thirdweb Connect provides various level of abstractions to connect wallets

1.  **ConectWallet UI component** for a prebuilt, ready to use UI component
2.  **hooks** for building a custom UI
3.  **Wallet SDK** for low level API for connecting wallets and integrating any wallet providers with thirdweb SDKs

### [1. ConnectWallet component](/connect/connect-wallet)

<div
  style={{
    display: "flex",
    justifyContent: "center",
    marginBottom: '50px'
}} >

  <img src="/assets/connect-wallet/connect-wallet-hero.webp" width="700" />
</div>

This is the easiest and quickest way to connect wallets in frontend. It requires no additional code and it is fully customizable. Just drop the component, customize it and you are done!

- Connect to hundreds of wallets
- Email & Social logins for better onboarding
- Gasless support when using with [Smart Wallets](/wallet/smart-wallet)
- Compatible with any EVM network (1000+ chains!)
- Completely customizable UI including theme colors, wallets, welcome screen etc.
- Support for [React](/connect/usage-with-react-sdk), [React Native](/connect/usage-with-react-native-sdk), and [Unity](/connect/usage-with-unity-sdk)
- Send and Receive Tokens directly from ConnectWallet component
- Shows balance, ENS name + Avatar, transaction history of connected wallet
- Integrates with thirdweb SDKs out of the box
- Ability to add SIWE authorization

<div className="col col--12" style={{ padding: 8 }}>
  <QuickstartCard
    name="Try out Connect Wallet Playground to see it in action!"
    link="https://thirdweb.com/dashboard/wallets/connect"
    image="/assets/product/connect-wallet.png"
  />
</div>

### 2. Hooks

Create a custom UI using the wallet connection hooks and easily to connect to [supported wallets](/connect/supported-wallets) in React / React Native.

### 3. Wallet SDK

[Wallet SDK](/connect/wallet-sdk) provides Low level API to Connect a wallet in backend or frontend. The ConnectWallet component uses the Wallet SDK internally to connect to wallets.

Wallet SDK comes out of the box with support for [most popular wallets](/wallet#popular-wallets-available). You can also easily add support for any other wallet provider by implementing a simple interface and integrate it with ConnectWallet component as mentioned in [this guide](/wallet/build-a-wallet)

There are two main instances in which you would use the Wallet SDK directly:

1. Connecting wallets in a back-end environment such as Node.js

2. Connecting wallets and using thirdweb's [TypeScript SDK](/typescript) instead of [React SDK](/react) in a non-React frontend app

3. In projects where you need low-level control of the wallet. Example: Needing to pass custom configuration options such as specifying a custom execute method for smartWallet as shown in this [Example](https://github.com/thirdweb-example/unilogin/tree/main)

<br />

## Integrates with thirdweb SDKs out of the box

Once you have connected a wallet, you can use the thirdweb's [React](/react), [React Native](/react-native), [TypeScript](/typescript) or [Unity](/unity) SDKs to interact with contracts, sign messages, and utilize common standards such as tokens, NFTs, marketplaces and a lot more to build powerful web3 applications with ease
